## homebrew-freecad-pg13

a little dumping ground repo / macos homebrew tap for me to experiment with tap maintenance.

### notes

it appears having the same formulae file name within this tap conflicts with the homebrew-freecad tap, so i prefixed formulae name with `pg13`

> pg is short playground, and pg13 is just a play on words.


## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install ipatch/freecad-pg13/<formula>`

Or `brew tap ipatch/freecad-pg13` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
